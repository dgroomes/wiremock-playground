ðŸ“š Learning and exploring WireMock.

This is a collection of Gradle sub-projects that showcase the excellent HTTP mock server _WireMock_ 
<http://wiremock.org/docs/>.

There are two sub-projects:

* [`programmatic/`](#programmatic)
* [`standalone/`](#standalone)

## `programmatic/`

The `programmatic/` sub-project showcases how to run the WireMock server programmatically via Java code and with 
various configurations. Use it like a recipe book for when you write your own WireMock code! 

Instructions:

* Use Java 11
* Run with `./gradlew programmatic:run`
* Make a request to a stubbed endpoint with `curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8070/message`
* Observe the Jetty server statistics by going to <http://localhost:8070/stats/> in your browser
  * Statistics include things like the number of responses with 200/300/400/500 status codes, the number of connections,
    and the amount of memory used by the underlying Jetty server.

## `standalone/`

The `standalone/` sub-project showcases how to run WireMock as a standalone process by downloading the
executable jar and running it. See the official docs at <http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/>.

Instructions:

* Use Java 11
* Run with `./gradlew standalone:run`
* Exit with `Ctrl + C`

## Wish List

General clean-ups, changes and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Make the sub-projects completely standalone and adhere to the convention I have in my other playground repos.
* Add a stub with a custom handler that uses custom Java code to respond to the request.
* Create a WireMock-in-Docker example
* DONE create a sub-project that declares dependency constraint versions and which will be used as a `platform(...)`
  from the other projects. For details of this feature, see the [Gradle docs about "platform"](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html)

## Notes

* Create a JDK Flight Recording
  * (see `java` options at <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/java.html> and scroll down to `-XX:StartFlightRecording`)
  * For the `programmatic` program:
    * Build the distribution with `./gradlew programmatic:installDist`
    * Set the JRE options with `export PROGRAMMATIC_OPTS="-XX:StartFlightRecording,dumponexit=true"`
    * Run the program with `programmatic/build/install/programmatic/bin/programmatic`
  * For the `standalone` program:
    * Build the distribution with `./gradlew standalone:installDist`
    * Set the JRE options with `export STANDALONE_OPTS="-XX:StartFlightRecording,dumponexit=true"`
    * Run the program with `standalone/build/install/standalone/bin/standalone`
  * After the program exits, the .jfr file will be captured. Visualize it using Mission Control <https://github.com/openjdk/jmc>
  * Clone Mission Control and build it
  * You must run it with a JDK 8 (and it must be installed at `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines...` for some reason. I couldn't get an SDKMAN installed Java to work)
    * E.g. `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home/ target/products/org.openjdk.jmc/macosx/cocoa/x86_64/JDK\ Mission\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/jmc -vm $JAVA_HOME/bin`
* Can we run WireMock on Graal? If Jetty can run on Graal, then WireMock should be pretty easy to run on Graal. See an
  example for running Jetty on Graal at <https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/issues/286>
