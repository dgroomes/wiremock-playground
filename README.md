## Overview

This is a collection of Gradle subprojects that showcase the excellent HTTP mock server _WireMock_ 
<http://wiremock.org/docs/>.

There are two subprojects:

* [`programmatic/`](#programmatic)
* [`standalone/`](#standalone)


## `programmatic/`

The `programmatic/` subproject showcases how to run the WireMock server programmatically via Java code and with 
various configurations. Use it like a recipe book for when you write your own WireMock code! 


### Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the example program.

1. Use Java 17
2. Build and run the program:
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew programmatic:run
     ```
3. Make requests to the stubbed endpoints:
   * ```shell
     curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8070/message
     ```
   * ```shell
     curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8070/random-integer
     ```
4. Observe the Jetty server statistics by going to <http://localhost:8070/stats/> in your browser
   * Statistics include things like the number of responses with 200/300/400/500 status codes, the number of connections,
     and the amount of memory used by the underlying Jetty server.


## `standalone/`

The `standalone/` subproject showcases how to run WireMock as a standalone process by downloading the
executable jar and running it. See the official docs at <http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/>.

### Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the standalone WireMock server.

1. Use Java 17
2. Run the standalone server
    * ```shell
      ./gradlew standalone:run
      ```
3. When you're done, stop the program with `Ctrl + C`


## Wish List

General clean-ups, changes and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Make the subprojects completely standalone and adhere to the convention I have in my other playground repos.
* [x] DONE Add a stub with a custom handler that uses custom Java code to respond to the request.
* [ ] SKIP (WireMock has its own Docker image now; great!) Create a WireMock-in-Docker example
* [x] DONE create a subproject that declares dependency constraint versions and which will be used as a `platform(...)`
  from the other projects. For details of this feature, see the [Gradle docs about "platform"](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html)
* [x] DONE Upgrade to Gradle 8.5
* [x] DONE Upgrade dependencies
* [x] DONE Upgrade to Java 17
* [ ] Upgrade to WireMock 3.0
* [ ] Upgrade to Java 21?
* [ ] Do something with proxying. Anything I care to have a reference for? Any nice new proxy features in WireMock 3.0?
* [ ] Add some stubs to the standalone project
* [ ] Remove the JFR stuff (although interesting; that kind of stuff belongs in other playground repos)


## Notes

* Create a JDK Flight Recording
  * (see `java` options at <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/java.html> and scroll down to `-XX:StartFlightRecording`)
  * For the `programmatic` program:
    * Build the distribution with `./gradlew programmatic:installDist`
    * Set the JRE options with `export PROGRAMMATIC_OPTS="-XX:StartFlightRecording,dumponexit=true"`
    * Run the program with `programmatic/build/install/programmatic/bin/programmatic`
  * For the `standalone` program:
    * Build the distribution with `./gradlew standalone:installDist`
    * Set the JRE options with `export STANDALONE_OPTS="-XX:StartFlightRecording,dumponexit=true"`
    * Run the program with `standalone/build/install/standalone/bin/standalone`
  * After the program exits, the .jfr file will be captured. Visualize it using Mission Control <https://github.com/openjdk/jmc>
  * Clone Mission Control and build it
  * You must run it with a JDK 8 (and it must be installed at `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines...` for some reason. I couldn't get an SDKMAN installed Java to work)
    * E.g. `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home/ target/products/org.openjdk.jmc/macosx/cocoa/x86_64/JDK\ Mission\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/jmc -vm $JAVA_HOME/bin`
* Can we run WireMock on Graal? If Jetty can run on Graal, then WireMock should be pretty easy to run on Graal. See an
  example for running Jetty on Graal at <https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/issues/286>
